Page builder plugin with front end live editing, full drag and drop editor much like a hybrid graphic design / web progam WYSWYG visual editor. Flux live page builder plguin is built much like a Windows based graphic design layout program rather then a online HTML editor, objects move freely to anywhere on page including on top or below other objects.
With the visual editor plugin as your guide you can create stunning visuals web designers create. The page builder uses hybred technology that allows your page to zoom, not unlike a high end photo editor. this technology was a leap forward in the form of layers based photo editors,
 like photoshop and corel draw.  With our editor your pages goes from 2D layout to 3D allowing for grid points to be fully used for pin point placement of objects.

Flux Live is the *<strong>"Best"</strong>* & *<strong>"Only"</strong>* adaptive page serving editor (Able to edit and serve a mobile page or full sized page depending upon the user's device.) for WordPress! 

*<strong>Fluid Motion Full Drag & Drop, </strong>* :  "Faster" & "Only" full drag and drop editor for WordPress! Objects move freely like your mouse does and can be placed nearly anywhere to the exact pixel location on your page. Other builders use place holders where a widet can be inserted into the page with many limitations, this type is native drag and drop. 

*<strong>fluctuating Editor & Page Server</strong>* : "Better" & "Only" Adaptive fluctuating Editor For WordPress! Better then just Responsive, you have seperate layouts for mobile and desktop version of your page, Flux Live then serves the best page layout for the users device and objects are scaled in size to fit the device size, this allows the look to remain the same on all devices and you can fully design your web page.

*<strong>Progressive Enhancements</strong>* : "Harder" & "Only" Hybrid editor for WordPress, with automated web technologies mixed together to obtain the most desired result for the users device. Flux Live allows mobile pages to maintain the design layout without pushing elements down the screen.

*<strong>Linear Grid Model</strong>* : Responive pages require a linear grid so that objects are free to push down the page when squezed, this highly limits the possibilities of design, Flux Live does not require a grid model and you are free to design the way it will look on all devices.

>We did not include the extras (Shopping Carts, Sliders, etc.) in our website builder, you have 1000s of plugins available to choose from. We just provided the one thing missing, the capibiity of A Full drag and drop editor with extras options,  that before now was unavailable to WordPress users.

>Build landing pages from scratch outside of your theme, full version has video webpage backgrounds, Parallax scrolling, transitions, full width template.



>Not just <strong>RESPONSIVE</strong> its <strong>Fluctuating design!</strong>

>Flux Live Visual Editor  uses <strong> Progressive Enhancements</strong>, to create a hybrid technology that allows mobile pages to maintain the design layout without pushing elements down the screen. The builder uses a 3D design for layout, allowing the stacking and overlay of objects in absolute positioning. Flux Live is a <strong>Adaptive Page Serving Editor</strong> and provides separate layouts for mobile devices and desktop page versions, when a user visits your site, Flux Live selects either the mobile or full version and <strong>Adapts</strong> to fit the users device screen size. The page then becomes <strong>Responsive</strong> and <strong>scales</strong> to fit the users device. This is much better then responsive because you are free from the linear grid required by the responsive page layout, your page will look the way you designed it to look, without content squeezing down the page.

=  Flux Live is the only "FULL" drag and drop visual editor available for WordPress =

>There are two full drag and drop website builders currently availabe online, Flux Live and the Wix editor. Full drag and drop editors allow you to move objects just about anywhere on your page, not just insert a widget into a place holder, the Flux Live webpage builder allows you to create much more dynamic pages with wordpress. Full drag and drop editors are "Adaptive" editors, this means you build a desktop and mobile versions of your page, whne a user visits your site Flux Live decides which page should be displayed and then serves the proper page to the device.

= Flux Live is a full drag and drop web site builder, front end visual editor and adaptve page server with all the option needed to build a modern website. =

>Flux Live Adaptive WYSIWYG Drag And Drop Visual Editor & Page Builder has some features of a word processor, desktop publisher and design layout program all in one. The Fluctuating HTML Editor is based on a 3D page building design with height, width and depth options available, standard online HTML editors are only based on 2D page editing design with height and width available.

The Flux Live website builder is a design layout program for those who want to create custom pages in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing experience. The HTML editor builder is layers based like many popular photo editors allowing for overlays and stacking of objects. 

=Adaptive VS Responsive=
Adaptive web design has confused many on what it actually is because it's not a design layout but a process of server side detection, the detection of a users device is used in selecting the proper page to display. All types of web design layout can be used including responsive layout, the only difference is the way the design is looked at from a (business card, letter, brochure) or (phone, pad, desktop) viewpoint rather than RWD one size fits all aproach to layout.

== FAQ ==

= What is a Adaptive Editor? = 

Adaptive Editors serve two pages, a Mobile page and a Desktop page.

= What are the advantages of this type of editor? = 

You can use the editor to create very custom pages suited to your users device.

= When should I use the page builder visual editor? =  

You should use the editor when you want a page that has design, not just a blog entry.


= What extra features does the advanced page builder editor have? =  

The advanced page builder has blank templates, video background templates, image background templates, and css transitions.
The visual editor also removes extra HTML the editor needs to function, allowing for faster download time.

= Image and video backgrounds built with the editor? =  

The Adaptive Editor bypasses your theme  and displays a blank template that loads a video or image in the background of the page. Since the HTML5 editor is 3D in nature you can layer and render objects that overlay the background of the page.

= What upgrades will be in new versions of the visual editor? =  

The current beta build of the visual editor has timelines for CSS transitions, and full page builder options outside of your theme.


= Can I edit my old pages with the editor? =  

No. The visual editor is a page builder, this means it requires a format for the HTML editor to function in drag and drop.

= Parallax Scrolling? =   

Parallax Scrolling allows objects to scroll at different speeds giving the illusion of 3D, the concept is used in cartoons and games to show movement. The page builder has a easy to use transistions pallete to set these options.

= Outside your theme Page Builder? =

Flux Live Advaced Version of the page builder can bypass your theme to create full blank pages you build from scratch.

= Page Builder Margins? =

The page builder has red and blue margins, if you edit within the blue margins you are safe, outside the blue you will need to test for overlap.


= Page Builder Inline Editor? =

The page builder inline editor is for fine tuning your page.
